## Context-Free Grammar Defined 

**Non-terminals:**
- PROGRAM: Represents the entire program.
- STATEMENT: Represents a single statement, which could be an assignment or display.
- MATRIX_ASSIGNMENT: Represents the assignment of a matrix literal to an identifier.
- MATRIX_MULT_ASSIGNMENT: Represents the assignment of the result of a matrix multiplication to an identifier.
- DISPLAY_STATEMENT: Represents the display of a matrix.

- OP_MUL: Multiplication operator x
- DISPLAY: Display keyword


**Production Rules:**

program -> statements 

statements -> statement statements | Îµ

statement -> matrix_assignment | maxtrix_mult_assignment | display_statement 

matrix_assignment -> id = matrix

Matrix -> matrix_row

Matrix_row -> (number, number) matrix_row| Îµ

maxtrix_mult_assignment -> id = id x id 

display_statement -> display id 

id -> A | B | C | D | E 

number -> int
